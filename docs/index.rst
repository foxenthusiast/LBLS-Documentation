Welcome to LBLS-Demo's documentation!
=====================================

LBLS is a project built using Flask, which allows you to manage and search for books through an API. (God bless OpenLibrary amirite?)
The project includes such amazing fantastical features like fetching book information from a Firebase database and displaying book data through a website with some help from OpenLibrary's API to make it look snazzy.
Amazing stuff isn't it?

Features
--------
- Search books by title or author.
- Display book thumbnails fetched from OpenLibrary API.
- Add, update, and delete book records.
- Be a Guaranteed inconvenience: Will be an utter drag, incredibly slow and painful. But we love him really!
