So Long, And Thanks For All The Fish
====================================

Welp, that's all folks!  

I don't actually know what to put here? This has certainly been one of the projects of all time!  
I'm pretty proud of it with it being my first ever actual attempt at making something with true purpose.  
Now hopefully whoever's reading this sometime in the future is able to look back on this and go, "Hey that's pretty neat! You did a good job!"  

You better damn thank me for making documentation..  
..which reminds me, was this documentation helpful? Who knows! Well, you do, not me though. If it is terribly unhelpful then please feel free to leave a heartfelt review in my inbox at:

*(I am never going to see that inbox once I leave, oopsie!)*  

Alas, I leave you with Douglas Adams' famous words,  

    So long, and thanks for all the fish.  

*(I have nothing to thank the reader for, you should be thanking me!!!)*
